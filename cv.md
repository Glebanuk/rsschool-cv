## Front-End developer

My goal is to master a new specialization for myself in which it will be possible to help people in various aspects of their lives and make the world around me more accessible both for myself and for other people. By implementing projects with lines of code and perseverance, you can amazingly change your life and those around you. And this thought inspires me to move on.I like discovering new knowledge and especially sharing it with other people.
